# fa22-capstone-2022-23-t06-build-commands

These are a list of build commands that are used to build our Unreal Engine 5 game on a Google Gloud server instance.

Rather that have some server image with the build commands that would need to be updated every time we wanted to make a change we use this repo to version control our commands.

The server pulls from this repo every time it builds to get the latest version of commands and zip the game correctly.
